%Many of the parameters specified above are linearly dependent and a number of them must therefore be fixed in order to obtain unique estimates. Firstly, the duration related utility is linear in time spent at an activity or travelling with a mode and could be written as: $u_{time} = \sum_a t_a \cdot \theta_a + \sum_m t_m \cdot \theta_m$. Since $\sum_a t_a + \sum_m t_m = T$ for all day-paths, changing the value of all linear time parameters by a constant $\delta$ will change the utility all day-paths by the same amount ($T\cdot \delta$). To normalize these parameters, $\theta_{\text{Rec Time}}$ is set to zero. All time parameters should thus be compared against $\theta_{\text{Rec Time}}$.
