To test how well the model manages to produce realistic behavior we simulated daily activity schedules for the observed individuals and compared some characteristics of the simulated data with the real data. Since we have parameters for travel time, travel cost, activity time, number of trips, etc., many quantities should be the same as in data (if we did not use sampling of alternatives). We are therefore focusing on quantities that we do not directly estimate but that are outcomes of the estimated parameters. Here we report result on activity timing, distribution of trips and tours, and trip length distribution.

Three factors determine the timing of activities: firstly, time constraints on working hours and child-errand times; secondly, preferences for when to arrive at work in the morning; and thirdly, preferences on when to be home. 
From figure \ref{fig:actstarttime} it seems as if these determinants are enough to predict when people go to work and when they get home. For child-errands, the start and end time for school is likely to play an important role, and this has not been included in the model. Start times for free time activities are quite well reproduced by the model, but slightly shifted towards later hours. This could also be due to the lack of opening hours in the model, or because only home-time utility is time-of-day dependent. Overall the model is able to reproduce the timing of activities very well.

\end{figure}

The distribution for number of trips and tours in a day is determined by a vast number of factors, but the total number should be correct as tour and trip constants are estimated. The tour constant is equal to the home constant, as each additional tour will include an additional trip home. A specific trip constant would not be possible to identify given the constants we already have for modes and activities, but these constants will together ensure that the number of trips is correct. However, we do not have any constants governing the distribution of the number of trips per day, number of tours per day or number of trips per tour. The overall structure of the model will therefore determine these distributions, and seems to be enough to give good predictions, as figure \ref{fig:tours} show.

The length of trips by mode will mainly be determined by the utility of time and money for respectively mode and by network characteristics. This gives a good distribution of travel times, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:triplength}. Since a large share of the trips are made to and from work, where the location is fixed and the trip is mandatory, the model is guaranteed to reproduce a large share of the trips well. However, the observed mode for the trip to work will only be the chosen mode in some of the simulated observations, and these restrictions will not give the distribution directly.

The ``same zone'' dummy parameter \param{same zone} for walk is negative, which seems contra-intuitive as one would expect walk to be the preferred mode of transport for shorter distances. From figure \ref{fig:triplength} it is clear that for same-zone trips (trips with zero travel time) walk is still the preferred mode of transport. The reason for this is that the mode specific constant $C_{\text{walk}}$ is the largest of the constants, even after adding $\delta_{\text{same zone}}$, and when the travel time is small it will therefore have the highest utility.

The parameters for travel time are almost the same for car, walk and bike but significantly smaller for PT. Since the travel time is longer for bike and walk, they will be less common for longer trips. PT has the smallest time coefficient and trips with longer travel time are therefore more common with public transport. The lower speed of bike and walk in comparison with the motorized modes will make them less common for longer trips, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:triplength}. The lower alternative specific constants, and the fact that more locations will become available with the same travel time with PT and car also make bike and walk less common.
