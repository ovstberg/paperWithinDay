	abstract = { This paper reports the results of an application of the Aurora model to estimate the utility functions underlying activity–duration decisions in daily activity–travel patterns. Multidimensional sequence alignment is used to derive segments for activity–travel diary data, collected in the Amsterdam–Utrecht corridor in the Netherlands. The profiles of the resulting segments are derived from a descriptive analysis of sociodemographic variables. A tailored genetic algorithm is then used to estimate the parameter of an asymmetrical utility function for each of the resulting segments. The results suggest that the utility of activity duration varies between activities and between segments, and hence sociodemographics. }

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a methodology capable of modeling travelers' postwork activity patterns and thus tracing the movements of travelers through space and time. After reviewing the state of the art in activity participation and scheduling, a modeling system consisting of a set of discrete / continuous models and duration-based models is specified and estimated. The discrete / continuous models are used to predict the travelers activity-type preference (discrete), the travel time to the activity and back home (continuous), and activity duration (continuous). Duration models are used to model the travelers home-stay duration capturing the factors that motivate travelers to terminate their home-stay and undertake additional out-of-home activities.},

	abstract="The persistence of environmental problems in urban areas and the prospect of increasing congestion have precipitated a variety of new policies in the USA, with concomitant analytical and modeling requirements for transportation planning. This paper introduces the Sequenced Activity-Mobility Simulator (SAMS), a dynamic and integrated microsimulation forecasting system for transportation, land use and air quality, designed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional four-step travel demand forecasting systems. The proposed SAMS framework represents a departure from many of the conventional paradigms in travel demand forecasting. In particular, it aims at replicating the adaptative dynamics underlying transportation phenomena; explicitly incorporates the time-of-day dimension; represents human behavior based on the satisficing, as opposed to optimizing, principle; and endogenously forecasts socio-demographic, land use, vehicle fleet mix, and other variables that have traditionally been projected externally to be input into the forecasting process.",

	abstract = {Because of the increasing time pressure they face, many consumers are becoming more concerned about the efficiency of their shopping patterns. Retailers have recognized this trend and have improved shopping convenience by offering greater variety in product categories and making it easier for consumers to combine visits to multiple stores. However, little is known about how consumers improve the efficiency of their shopping trips or how changes in retail supply affect the way in which consumers combine multiple purposes and destinations. Building on previous work in consumer shopping trip modeling and conjoint design theory, the authors introduce a choice-based conjoint approach to studying and modeling this phenomenon. The authors illustrate the approach in a case study that investigates the tendency of Dutch shoppers to combine grocery, drugstore, and clothing purchases across multiple shopping destinations. The authors observe that the tendency of consumers to combine purchases differs from category to category and depends on category availability. In general, consumers combine considerably fewer purchases than could be expected if their shopping trip planning was based purely on travel cost minimization.},
